        "**Question 1**: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y) by fitting a straight line through the data points.\n",
        "The purpose of SLR is to predict the value of Y based on X and to understand how changes in X affect Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2:** What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Linearity: The relationship between X and Y is linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Homoscedasticity: The variance of residuals is constant across all values of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "Normality: Residuals (errors) are normally distributed.\n",

        "Predicting a student’s exam score (Y) based on hours studied (X).\n",
        "As study hours increase, exam scores generally increase, and the relationship can be modeled using a simple linear regression line.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 5:** What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The method of least squares estimates regression coefficients (β₀ and β₁) by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (differences between actual and predicted values).\n",

        ":**  What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Logistic Regression is used for classification problems where the dependent variable is categorical (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1). It models the probability that Y belongs to a certain category using the logistic (sigmoid) function.\n",

        "Logistic Regression: Predicts probabilities or binary outcomes (e.g., 0 or 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear regression uses a straight line; logistic regression uses an S-shaped (sigmoid) curve.\n",

        "**Question 7:**  Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.\n",
        "\n",

        "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",

        "Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE; gives error in same units as the dependent variable.\n",

        "**Question 8:**  What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "R-squared (R²) measures how well the regression line fits the data. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
